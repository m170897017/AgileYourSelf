AgileYourSelf
=============

This is an android APP used for project management. It's running in agile way.
It can collaborate with a website, which has not been developed, to project management.

1. In fact, every item in my project tab is one single user story. It contains all the elements a user story needs: a brief description, estimation, points, priority, status, owner and alarm.
2. And different user stories will have different colour. Through this, we can find out what's most urgent with only a simple glimpse.
3. Users can upload their own plans to server and view others' through disover tab. 
4. All the user stories belong to one team will be listed in team tab.
5. In the website, there will be burn down chart. And we can update project progress as we like by simple dragging and so on. That's another topic.

Here is what demo looks like.
